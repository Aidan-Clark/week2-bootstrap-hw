# The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
## Promotional Website

![A screenshot of the home page of the website](front-page-cap.png)

This website was a one day project to practice my HTML and CSS skills. The website has 3 pages:

* Home
* Champions
* Landmarks

which can be switched between using the navigation bar at the top. Most of the text is filler; the content of the website didn't matter. What *did* matter was the layout, and how the website was built. A link to the website can be found
[here](http://Aidan-Clark.github.io/week2-bootstrap-hw).

Unfortunately, I didn't have time to make the website responsive, so it may visually break on some screens. If I have time in the future, this is something I'll come back to work on.
